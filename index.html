            <p><span class="lede-in">Inside a virtual operating room,</span> a patient lies, chest open, on the table. An observer, wearing a virtual reality headset and clutching a joystick gently tugs at a digital skeleton’s chest and a three-dimensional model of his beating heart appears. The digital model is anatomically perfect, right down the physics of how various cardiac tissues work. The observer zooms in and enters the heart through the superior vena cava, following the blood flow to the right atrium. As the atrium contracts, the onlooker speeds through the right ventricle, out the pulmonary valve and into pulmonary artery, where the blood is oxygenated.</p>
            <p>At the annual Dassault Systemes’ 3D Experience Playground, individuals can explore more than a dozen highly realistic simulations. The experiences are not your run-of-the-mill virtual reality games. The models are mathematically accurate digital recreations of physical systems and they are the showpieces of Dassault’s four-day conference, Science in the Age of Experience, a TED-style meeting of talks and workshops that explores how 3D digital environments can advance science and industry.</p>
            <p>This year’s meeting took place in June in Boston. There, in the playground, users dove into realistic computational models from areas such as cardiovascular research, aerodynamics, acoustics, materials science, electromagnetics, and gustatory perception. One particularly robust simulation employed field computation to track the specific absorption rate of radiation emitted by a user’s smart watch. Another modeled the in-flight experience, so users could determine—with their own ears—if a plane’s cabin design adequately muffled engine noise.</p>
            <p>These simulations, or digital twins as they’re called, allow scientists and engineers to make virtual much of the work that was once exclusively physical. With computationally accurate models, the need to crash real cars or test real drug interactions decreases. That makes operations cheaper, tests faster, and advances more forthcoming. Dassault Systemes develops 3D-design, digital mockup and product lifecycle management software, and as Bernard Charles, the CEO, said at the conference in June, “When science and innovation intersect, the future comes into focus.”</p>

        <h3 class="subhead">Discovery:</h3>
        <h2 class="subhead-quote">“This will open the doors to many people.”</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p><span class="lede-in">The bedrock of science</span> is the scientific method—hypothesize, experiment and analyze. Digital twins allow scientists to make that process virtual. The result is that science can happen faster.</p>
            <p>The simplest way to think about this cycle of acceleration is that scientists can perform experiments much more quickly in silico than in vitro or in vivo. But there are other, more subtle factors that drive the cycle of acceleration too. Access is one.</p>
            <p>“This will open many doors for many people,” says Reza Sadeghi, chief scientific officer of Biovia, a division of Dassault. 3D experiences. “Now people are pushing buttons, getting answers that in the past would require the knowledge of a deep learning scientist or engineer.” The more people who have access to reliable tools and use them to do science – provided they use them correctly – the more quickly discoveries arrive.</p>
            <p>Digital twins also facilitate collaboration, a potent force multiplier for science. Computational modeling enables a group of individuals with varying expertise to come together to focus on a certain topic. Francine Acher, a medicinal chemist and director of research at Universite Paris Descartes, uses Dassault’s software to collaborate with biologists and behavioral experts to study brain diseases such as Parkinson’s, Schizophrenia, addiction and epilepsy.</p>
            <p>“A multidisciplinary project can only be successful if we interact very well between experts,” she says. “It all starts and ends with the modeling.” Virtual models are now being used to optimize drugs, to increase binding affinity at glutamate receptors and to validate molecular interactions of molecules.</p>
            <p>The FDA has even started using simulation to expedite discovery. With nearly 200,000 medical devices on the market in the U.S., and 20,000 new submissions received by the FDA each year, the agency is using in silico clinical trials to understand the performance of devices beyond what has been clinically tested. “We’re leveraging simulation to augment the need for clinical data in some areas,” says Tina Morrison, chief advisor of computational modeling for the FDA’s Office of Device Evaluation. “We can simulate the device, a patient’s anatomy, physiology, chemical toxicology and much more.”</p>

        <h3 class="subhead">Manufacturing:</h3>
        <h2 class="subhead-quote">“Simulation is the language for innovation.”</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p><span class="lede-in">“Simulation is the language for innovation</span> in composites manufacturing,” said Byron Pipes, professor of engineering at Purdue University during his keynote address at the Science in the Age of Experience conference in June. Pipes is an expert in additive manufacturing, or 3D printing. The field has long been on the verge of transforming traditional manufacturing but has never quite taken off. Simulation, Pipes says, may turn that promise into reality.</p>
            <p>For engineers in fields such as automotive, aerospace and defense, two drawbacks of additive manufacturing are the pace of production and the knowledge gaps that appear across a supply chain, leading to inefficiencies. In his research, Pipes has found the way to circumvent those challenges is to rely on the language of simulation. When simulation is woven into a project from start to finish, experts throughout the supply chain can stay on the same page, speeding the rate of production and eliminating potential errors and added costs.</p>
            <p>Beyond improving additive manufacture, simulations can be used to improve materials themselves. Stefanie Feih, senior scientist at Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, uses process simulation to predict manufacturing defects of composite structures, as well as the effect that such defects could have on performance. “The design loop from the structure to the final product predicts how a material will behave,” she says.</p>
            <p>Feih takes inspiration from nature to see how she can improve composite structures. “Nature rotates things around, putting more lattices where stiffness is needed. To mimic this, we came up with an algorithm that aligns cells to the load cases that we have, and then we use a code that calculates spacing, 3D design and alignment to put everything in the right place,” she explains.</p>

        <h3 class="subhead">Medicine:</h3>
        <h2 class="subhead-quote">“This is just the beginning.”</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p><span class="lede-in">The single greatest trend</span> in medicine is the movement toward personalized medicine. The premise is that with enough data, doctors could give patients the exact treatments they need at the exact moments they need them. The Living Heart Project is one large step in that direction.</p>
            <p>The digital model of an anatomically accurate heart displayed this June in the 3DExperience Playground is currently used by clinicians, educators, medical device manufacturers and regulatory agencies to study cardiac defects, diseased states and treatments. It allows researchers to test their hypotheses on digital representations rather than actual humans, speeding the rate of innovation without compromising safety.</p>
            <p>The Living Heart Project is a start not an end. The hope is that models of other organs will follow, perhaps the brain, lungs or liver.</p>
            <p>In that future, Sadeghi from Biovia says, a patient could walk into a doctor’s office and receive an anatomical scan. That scan would inform 3D organ models, which could serve as virtual testbeds for treatments and side effects. “There will be an exact replica of an organ to study the reaction of a drug or procedure,” he says. “This is just the beginning.”</p>
            <p>To a degree, that future is already upon us. In Belgium, a digital health company called Digital Orthopaedics uses digital modeling to nearly foolproof surgical procedures. The startup creates personalized foot models for each patient and then, uses realistic simulation to help surgeons identify the best orthopedic treatments for specific individuals. “We simulate the surgery before actually performing the surgery,” says Eric Halioua, CEO of Digital Orthopaedics. “By predicting surgery before making the surgery, we reduce the amount of surgical procedures that are not adequately done and improve patients’ outcomes, while decreasing costs associated with care.”</p>
            <p>Medicine will drive the development of simulations but, “The concept could spread across industries” says Bruce Engelmann, vice president and chief technology officer of Dassault Systemes’ Simulia brand. “We can now solve so many complicated problems across so many different physics. It comes down to building more and more complexity into the models, while making them easier to use, so they’re accessible for the scientist, for the engineer and for anyone, even the mere mortal.”</p>
